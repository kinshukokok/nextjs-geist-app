# Detailed Implementation Plan for SNG Medicos Website

This plan outlines all the changes and dependent files to implement the SNG Medicos website with a clean, modern green–white theme.

---

## 1. Global Styles & Theme Setup

- **File:** `src/app/globals.css`
  - Add custom CSS variables or Tailwind config overrides for the green and white theme.
  - Ensure responsive typography, spacing, and layout rules are set.
  - Include any base resets and accessibility styles.
  
- **File:** `postcss.config.mjs` & `next.config.ts`
  - Verify Tailwind is correctly configured to pick up custom classes if any modifications are done.

---

## 2. Header Component

- **File:** `src/components/Header.tsx`
  - Create a new component for the header.
  - Layout:
    - Left: Text-based logo “SNG Medicos” styled boldly in green.
    - Center: A search bar (`<input>`) with placeholder text “Search Medicines” and proper ARIA attributes.
    - Right: Two clickable text buttons for “Cart” and “Login” with hover effects.
  - Ensure responsiveness (stacking or collapsing on smaller screens).

---

## 3. Banner Section

- **File:** `src/components/Banner.tsx`
  - Create a Banner component for the top section.
  - Use an `<img>` tag with:
    - `src` set to  
      `https://placehold.co/1920x1080?text=Happy+family+with+medicines+and+healthcare+products`
    - `alt` attribute: “Happy family enjoying authentic medicines and healthcare products in a bright modern setting.”
    - An `onerror` attribute to gracefully handle loading errors.
  - Overlay the following text centered on the image:
    - “SNG Medicos – Genuine Medicines, Best Discounts, Fast Delivery Across India.”
  - Add a prominent “Shop Now” button below the text, styled with Tailwind classes.

---

## 4. Offers & Discounts Section

- **File:** `src/components/OffersDiscounts.tsx`
  - Create a component to display current offers:
    - “Flat ₹150 OFF on first order.”
    - “Up to 50% OFF on selected medicines.”
    - “Free Delivery on orders above ₹999.”
  - Use cards or list items with balanced padding and margin within a responsive grid.
  - Apply the green–white color scheme for emphasis.

---

## 5. Medicine Categories Section

- **File:** `src/components/MedicineCategories.tsx`
  - Build a grid layout to showcase categories such as:
    - Fever & Pain Relief, Cold & Cough, Diabetes Care, Heart & BP Care, Vitamins & Supplements, Skin & Hair Care, Mother & Baby, Personal Care & Hygiene, Surgical & Devices.
  - Each category appears as a card with a title and brief description.
  - Use a clean typography layout without external icon libraries; rely on styled text and borders.

---

## 6. Popular Medicines Section

- **File:** `src/components/PopularMedicines.tsx`
  - Create a component that lists top-selling medicines.
  - Each item should include:
    - Medicine name, price, discount information.
  - Display items in a grid or list with consistent card formatting.

---

## 7. Why Choose Us Section

- **File:** `src/components/WhyChooseUs.tsx`
  - Implement a section highlighting features:
    - “Fast Delivery”, “Big Discounts”, “100% Genuine.”
  - Use simple cards with a combination of bold text and subtle background blocks.
  - Emphasize points with clear typography and spacing rather than icons.

---

## 8. Customer Reviews Section

- **File:** `src/components/CustomerReviews.tsx`
  - Develop a component to display customer testimonials.
  - Use a carousel or grid format:
    - Each testimonial includes a short review text and a placeholder for a user avatar.
    - For avatars, use an `<img>` tag with:
      - `src` as `https://placehold.co/100x100?text=User+Avatar`
      - Descriptive `alt` text and an `onerror` fallback.
  - Ensure testimonials have accessible design and consistent spacing.

---

## 9. Footer Component

- **File:** `src/components/Footer.tsx`
  - Create a footer that contains multiple columns:
    - Contact information, About, Policies, and Social Media links (display these as text links).
  - Use a clear, minimal layout with appropriate spacing and contrast.

---

## 10. Home Page Integration

- **File:** `src/app/page.tsx`
  - Import and compose all the new components in the following order:
    1. `<Header />`
    2. `<Banner />`
    3. `<OffersDiscounts />`
    4. `<MedicineCategories />`
    5. `<PopularMedicines />`
    6. `<WhyChooseUs />`
    7. `<CustomerReviews />`
    8. `<Footer />`
  - Wrap the components in semantic HTML tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
  - Add error boundaries if needed for enhanced stability.

---

## 11. Additional Files & Best Practices

- **File:** `README.md`
  - Update the documentation with installation instructions, development server commands, and a summary of new components.
  
- **ESLint & TypeScript:**
  - Review `eslint.config.mjs` and `tsconfig.json` to ensure new components adhere to the project’s standards.
  - Add error handling in any event handlers (e.g., search on header) using try-catch where applicable.

- **Accessibility & Responsiveness:**
  - Ensure every `<img>` has descriptive `alt` text and error handling.
  - Use semantic tags and ARIA attributes.
  - Test pages on various screen sizes to maintain a clean, responsive layout.
